# Python Code Challenge Assessment


This repository contains solutions to the Python assessment tasks outlined below. The tasks cover fundamental Python concepts, including basic data structures, functions, decorators, sequences, sets, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming.

## Repository Setup


To set up this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/toxidity-18/Python-CodeChallange-Fundamentals.git`.
2. Open the repository in your Visual studio code .

## Running the Application


To run the application, navigate to the repository directory in your terminal and execute the following command:
 ```python function.py 
    python OOP.py
    python sets_and_dicts.py
    python sequences.py
 
 ```
 ## Task
 



### Function: add_numbers 

The `add_numbers` function takes two parameters `num1` and `num2` and returns the sum of the two numbers.

### Function: is_even 

The `is_even` function takes a single parameter `number` and returns `True` if the number is even, and `False` otherwise.

### Function: reverse_string 

The `reverse_string` function takes a string `text` as input and returns the reversed version of that string.

### Function: count_vowels

The `count_vowels` function takes a string `text` as input and returns the count of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string. Ignore case sensitivity.

### Function: calculate_factorial 

The `calculate_factorial` function takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the factorial of that number. The factorial of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`.

### Function: apply_decorator

The `apply_decorator` function takes a function `func` as input and applies a decorator named `decorator_func`. The decorator should simply print "Decorator Applied" before calling the original function.

### Sequences: Sort List of Tuples 

The `sort_by_age` function takes a list of tuples where each tuple contains a `name` and an `age`, and sorts the list of tuples by `age` in ascending order.

### Sets and Dictionaries: Merge Dictionaries

The `merge_dicts` function takes two dictionaries as input and merges them into a single dictionary. If there are any common keys, their values should be summed up.

###  Object-Oriented Programming: Class Creation 

The `Car` class has the following attributes: `make`, `model`, `year`. The `display_info` method prints out the car's information.
